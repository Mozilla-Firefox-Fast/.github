## What is Mozilla Firefox?

**Mozilla Firefox** is a modern, open-source web browser developed by the Mozilla Foundation with a strong focus on privacy, security, performance, and user control. Unlike many browsers built around data collection, Firefox is designed to protect users from tracking, intrusive ads, fingerprinting, and malicious scripts by default.

Firefox uses its own **Gecko/Quantum** engine, delivering fast page rendering, efficient memory usage, and excellent standards compliance. It supports thousands of extensions, advanced developer tools, multi-device sync, and deep customization, making it a preferred browser for developers, privacy-conscious users, professionals, and everyday browsing alike.
